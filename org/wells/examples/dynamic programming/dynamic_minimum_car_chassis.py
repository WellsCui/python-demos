# # A car factory has two assembly lines, each with n stations. A station is denoted by Si,j where i is either 1 or 2
# #  and indicates the assembly line the station is on, and j indicates the number of the station. The time taken per
# # station is denoted by ai,j. Each station is dedicated to some sort of work like engine fitting, body fitting,
# # painting and so on. So, a car chassis must pass through each of the n stations in order before exiting the factory.
# # The parallel stations of the two assembly lines perform the same task. After it passes through station Si,j,
# # it will continue to station Si,j+1 unless it decides to transfer to the other line. Continuing on the same line
# # incurs no extra cost, but transferring from line i at station j â€“ 1 to station j on the other line takes time ti,j.
# #  Each assembly line takes an entry time ei and exit time xi which may be different for the two lines. Give an algorithm
# # for computing the minimum time it will take to build a car chassis.
#
#
# # The following information can be extracted from the problem statement to make it simpler:
# #
# # Two assembly lines, 1 and 2, each with stations from 1 to n.
# # A car chassis must pass through all stations from 1 to n in order(in any of the two assembly lines). i.e.
# # it cannot jump from station i to station j if they are not at one move distance.
# # The car chassis can move one station forward in the same line, or one station diagonally in the other line.
# # It incurs an extra cost ti, j to move to station j from line i. No cost is incurred for movement in same line.
# # The time taken in station j on line i is ai, j.
# # Si, j represents a station j on line i.
